					<h3>The Impermanence of Software</h3>
					<p>As engineers we place a lot of emphasis in the things that we build. However lots of the software we write is destined for deletion. What does this do to our definition of 'doing great work'?</p>
					<p>Is "great work" inherent to the code you write? Is it your customer's results? Is it anything to do with the output in the first place?</p>
					<p>Come and examine the role of teams, personal relationships and your own attitude in your day to day work, as well as in the broader cycle of a whole career and our industry.</p>

					<h3>Limitation breeds creativity</h3>
					<p>In Web Development, the sheer volume of things to learn can be overwhelming. </p>
					<p>Pair this with anxiety and a tendency to procrastinate and you’ve got the perfect recipe for doing absolutely nothing. </p>
					<p>Constraints might not feel like what you want when you're trying to kickstart creativity or start a new project. But working within constraints can help you get started and provide unconventional ways around a problem. </p>
					<p>Come along to see me demo a few of Cassie's favourite unconventional solutions. </p>

					<h3>How working within parameters can be a catalyst for creativity</h3>
					<p>As commercial designers, we work within set parameters, be they budget, ‘the brief’ or technology. In my talk, I will give examples, outside of the commercial world we work in, of how working within limitations and dogma can produce creative solutions which would not have come about without these limitations.</p>

					<h2>Candi & Mike</h2>
					<p>Your MCs for the evening, Mike and Candi are like the Phil and Holly of the web world. Introductions, jokes and general professional hilarity will ensue.</p>
					<p>Candi is an account manager extraordinaire - talking to people is her job, so you’ll feel like you’ve be friends for years even when she is only introducing herself. Musically inclined, we have to make sure she doesn’t break out into song spontaneously.</p>
					<p>Mike couldn’t be more opposite - a developer who can’t hold a tune to save his life (despite having a music production degree). Old before his time, expect puns and dad jokes scattered throughout the evening.</p>
					<p>These two are the mortar to the bricks that are the speakers, the &lt;div&gt;s to their content and the opening credits that you skip to watch the TV show. They are the mere vessels which allow you to consume the content which are the Bytes Conf talks. The creators of Bytes Conf, feel free to compliment or complain to them - they are are your beck and call.</p>
